# FORTHOSV — Portfolio

> The first ever CRT-designed portfolio website.
> Built from scratch by **Abdildenov Adil** · 03.06.2026

A single-file portfolio that boots like a 1990s television set. Every pixel on screen is rendered through a WebGL CRT shader — curvature, shadow-mask phosphors, scanlines, chromatic aberration, grain, bezel vignette, and a power-on sweep. There is no framework, no build step, no dependencies. Just one `index.html`.

## Live Demo

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. That's it.

For mobile and accessibility, a clean ATS-style résumé renders as a fallback for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` or no WebGL.

## What Makes It Different

Most "retro CRT" sites slap a scanline overlay on top of normal HTML. This one doesn't.

- **The entire page is drawn into a `<canvas>`** — typography, navigation, project cards, everything. There is no DOM under the glass.
- **The canvas is then uploaded as a texture** to a custom GLSL fragment shader that simulates the physics of an aperture-grille CRT.
- **Two textures, two render modes.** Large display text gets the full heavy-mask treatment; small body text uses a second "relief" texture with a finer phosphor cell so it stays legible without losing the CRT look.
- **Hit-testing happens in curved space.** Click coordinates are inverse-mapped through the same barrel distortion the shader applies, so links and nav buttons remain clickable exactly where they appear on the curved screen.

## Features

### CRT Simulation
- Barrel curvature with edge vignette and bezel
- Aperture-grille shadow mask with offset slot pattern
- Per-line horizontal scanlines synced to virtual resolution
- Chromatic aberration that scales with distance from center
- Phosphor washout on bright luma
- Animated grain + brightness flicker (60 Hz hum + slow drift)
- Power-on sweep ("CRT warm-up") and channel-change static between pages

### Interactive Type
- The **FORTHOSV** ASCII logo is built cell-by-cell. Each glyph picks a random scramble character on a randomized interval, so the logo is always quietly "tuning."
- Hovering the mouse near the logo locks nearby cells into red `accent` color and re-scrambles them — a tactile, magnetic effect.

### Pages
- `HOME` — animated ASCII identity
- `PROJECTS` — slideshow with prev/next, dot indicator, deep-linked YouTube preview
- `ABOUT` — education + skills grid
- `CONTACT` — clickable email / GitHub / Instagram / Telegram

### Keyboard
- `1` `2` `3` `4` — jump to nav tabs
- `Esc` — return to HOME
- `← → ↑ ↓` — paginate projects

### Fallback
- No WebGL or `prefers-reduced-motion`? You get a print-clean, recruiter-ready résumé page with proper semantic HTML.

## Architecture

```
index.html
├── <style>      → bezel + ATS fallback résumé
├── <main.fb>    → semantic resume (SEO + a11y + no-JS fallback)
├── <canvas#gl>  → CRT screen
└── <script>
    ├── CONFIG          → every visual knob in one place
    ├── PAGES           → content as data, not markup
    ├── 2D canvas (page)   → ink layer, drawn each frame
    ├── 2D canvas (page2)  → relief layer (small-text-only)
    └── WebGL shader       → reads both textures, outputs CRT pixels
```

### Why two textures?
To make small text more readable. I could use size based texture but it would not work on ASCII Forthosv text so i made a selectable textures.

### Why draw into canvas instead of DOM?
Because the shader needs a *single image* to distort. CSS `transform` can't bend text. Putting everything through canvas means typography, layout, and the CRT effect are all driven by the same pipeline — no jank between layers, no z-fighting, no overlay seams.

## Configuration

Open `index.html`, find the `CONFIG` block at the top of the script, tweak any value, refresh.

| Knob | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `curvature` | How aggressively the screen bulges |
| `frame` | Outer bezel inset (1.0 = full screen, >1.0 reveals bezel) |
| `aberration` | RGB channel split strength |
| `grain` | Per-pixel noise level |
| `maskStrength` | Shadow-mask darkening — higher = more visible phosphors |
| `maskCell` / `reliefMaskCell` | Phosphor cell size for headlines / body text |
| `scanDepth` / `reliefScanDepth` | Scanline contrast for headlines / body text |
| `gain` / `reliefGain` | Brightness compensation after mask multiply |
| `asciiScrambleHz` | How fast the logo rerolls (Hz) |
| `asciiHoverRadius` | Cursor magnetism radius around the logo |
| `bootMs` / `transMs` | Boot animation and page-change duration |

The `paper`, `ink`, `dim`, `accent`, and `rule` color tokens drive the entire palette. Change them and the whole site re-themes.

## Performance

- One shader pass per frame, two texture uploads per page change (not per frame).
- The canvas is only re-rendered when:
  - the window resizes,
  - the page changes,
  - the user clicks a project dot,
  - the user moves the mouse over the logo,
  - or the ASCII scramble timer ticks (10 Hz, only on HOME).
- Idle pages render at zero cost — the shader keeps drawing the same texture.

Target: 60 fps on integrated graphics. Texture size is clamped to `min(devicePixelRatio, 2)`.

---

## Stack

- **Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS** — no framework, no bundler
- **WebGL 1** — fragment shader for the CRT effect
- **Canvas 2D** — typography and layout rendering
- **Zero dependencies** — opens offline, deploys anywhere static
